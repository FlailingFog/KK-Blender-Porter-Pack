# KK Blender Porter Pack
Plugin pack for exporting and setting up Koikatsu characters in Blender.  

The ```KKBP exporter for Koikatsu``` is used to export the character's mesh, armature and color data. The exported data is then processed by the ```KKBP plugin for Blender```. Once characters are setup in Blender, they can be saved as FBX files for use in other programs. 

The changelog for the pack [can be found here.](https://github.com/FlailingFog/KK-Blender-Shader-Pack/blob/master/Changelog.md)
