# KK Blender Porter Pack

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FlailingFog/flailingfog.github.io/master/assets/images/readme.png)

Plugin pack for exporting and cleaning up Koikatsu characters in Blender.  

The ```KKBP exporter for Koikatsu``` exports the character's mesh, armature and color data from the game. The ```KKBP importer for Blender``` processes that data to setup the character in Blender. Once characters are setup in Blender, they can be saved as FBX files for use in other programs.
