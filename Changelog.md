    * KKBP now has an 80% success rate out of the box! [Check this page for more details.](https://flailingfog.github.io/material_breakdown)
* You can change the colors straight from the materials tab now, so you don't have to touch the material nodes if you don't want to
* Hair materials are no longer linked. Click on a hair material, modify it and then click the "Update hair materials" button in the material tab to update the rest of the hair materials with the same settings
* Almost every material node setup was recreated from scratch, so it is now very easy to follow what the material nodes are doing
    * including automatic generation of detail colors, so those will be different too
* A lot of the material related code in the addon was rewritten from scratch, so it is now much easier to follow what the python script is loading in to each material slot
* Glasses materials are now transparent instead of being completely white (only the glass part, not the frame)
* Character name is used in collection now
* Character name is used in all objects now to ensure they are unique
* Character name is used in all materials now to ensure they are unique

* Added a switch to use eyebrow main textures with color
* Removed the shader to rgb nodes on KK General's color inputs
* Merged Eyewhite materials L and R into one
* Removed unused LUT images
* Removed baked image slot on all materials. Baked materials are now tracked through custom attributes
* Some very specific colors are now hard coded because the ones being loaded in were not great. 
    * You can still change them, but they won't react to any changes you make in game.
* Dark main textures now keep their alpha channel when generated
* Node groups related to the KKBP shaders will no longer show up in the material node search (they have a "." in front of them now)

### Changes for V7.2.2
* New Unreal Engine export option by **AnalogKnight**!

### Changes for V7.2.1
* fixed an issue with the armature not being reparented after baking

### Changes for V7.2.0
* Fixed crashes when creating a material atlas!
    * This feature will now use atlas generation scripts borrowed from the [material-combiner-addon](https://github.com/Grim-es/material-combiner-addon)
    * You will have to install pillow by clicking on the button in the KKBP panel (this uses pip, so it requires an internet connection)
* More headmods will now import thanks to **VickyFrenzy**!
    * The plugin expected all body materials to be present, but some headmods either remove or rename these materials, causing errors. Now it will skip some materials if they don't exist, allowing the headmod to at least import so you can fix it manually
* Chinese translation fixes and updates by **AnalogKnight**!
* Backported the plugin to work in Blender 3.6
    * Only the import features work, so no exporting from 3.6
* Added a button to revert all of your finalized materials back to the -ORG / "heavyweight" version of the material
* Foot IKs will finally work correctly on taller characters
* The "prep for target application" button will now allow you to simplify the KK and PMX armatures
* Add back linux / mac support (again)

### Changes for V7.1.0
* New image saturation method
* ~~Add back linux / mac support~~

### Changes for V7.0.0
* Blender 4.2 LTS support!
    * You need the new version of [mmd_tools](https://extensions.blender.org/add-ons/mmd-tools/)
* Koikatsu Sunshine exporter bugfix by **Guerra24**!
    * This fixes colors not showing up on KKS exports that had their material set to "Koikano"
* Replaced Generated Face Normal smoothing with a new geometry nodes setup from **MoriMorinya**! (original node group by **aVersionOfReality**)
* Added a button to import a single ripped animation from the game onto your model!
    * This feature requires Rokoko studio live plugin to be installed
    * This supports Mixamo animations too thanks to **hsxfunc**
* Import KeyError fixes by **justturniphead**!
* Chinese translation updates by **AnalogKnight**!
* Normal maps are now loaded into the optimized material thanks to **FrankV724**!
* The KKBP plugin can now generate a material atlas by itself! 
    * The plugin also automatically generates a copy of your model that uses the atlas
    * This feature does not have a pixel limit, so if the atlas is too large, you can split up your objects and re-generate it
* Streamlined the KKBP main panel!
    * There's now only one button for importing, one for optimizing materials and one for exporting
    * If a button in the panel cannot be used, it will now be grayed out. Some features (like the animation import feature) require you to use the Rigify armature, and other features (like the prep for export button) require you to use the KKBP armature
* During very long sequences, like when finalizing materials or bone simplification, the plugin will now attempt to give you progress information
* Generating dark colors and textures can now be skipped to slightly speed up import times
* Blue pixels on textures should now be fixed
    * This appeared to be an issue with certain blender versions. You can now manually download any version of blender.exe between 2.80 and 3.6 and make the KKBP importer use the version you downloaded for generating the textures, so if the built in downloads for 2.90 or 3.6.9 are not working you can experiment with different blender versions until you find one that is working.
* Updated the colors in the KK Shader to look good in the default "Blender dark" theme
* Updated the plugin to be a Blender 4.2 extension (it is no longer a legacy addon)
* Renamed the folders inside of the exporter zip to be clearer
* Added decompiled source code for the KKBP_Exporter.dll to the exporter zip (thanks to **Guerra24**)
* Moved wiki and usage instructions to a github pages site: https://flailingfog.github.io

    * If this addon isn't installed, maps and objects will still import, but their orientations and locations may be incorrect
* Added a button to "Finalize" a material
    * Finalizing materials will improve viewport performance during animation playback
    * This will replace the heavy KKBP node groups with a simple texture + toon shader
    * You need to bake light and dark versions of the model to a folder, then use the "Switch baked templates" button for the Light and the Dark selection before attempting to use the "Finalize materials" button
    * The original materials are saved as "material_name-ORG" if you need to go back to edit or bake them again
* Updated Rigify scripts (January 24th)
    * These contain a bugfix related to headmods
* The KKBP and Rigify armatures now have slight knee deformation drivers to smooth out the knee in kneeling poses
* On Windows, the console will now show during long operations (importing characters, baking, importing animations, etc)
    * This will help the user more easily identify errors. If an error is encountered, the console will remain open after the operation is complete
* Clothes without a shadow color will now generate a dark texture with a default shadow color (instead of not generating and appearing completely white)
* Using both the Rigify and Cycles options on the panel will no longer result in a rotated body mesh

* Only new textures will be saturated when the Import Studio Object button is used
* Baking materials should work on Linux and Mac now

### Changes for V6.3.0
* Blender 3.4 support
    * Models will no longer get a [KeyError 'color'] error during import
    * Baking with KKBP 6.3.0 will only work on Blender 3.4+ due to a change with the Mix node
* Added a script to generate a pose asset library from ripped Koikatsu animation data
    * Open the .py file in KKBP / extras / animationlibrary for usage instructions
    * See [this video](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65811931/211217974-66e3a961-8e40-4244-b7a4-11f6d4bbcb14.mp4) for a finished example
* Importing is slightly faster for cards that have a lot of alphamasks or maintexes

### Changes for V6.2.0
* Dark colors and textures for clothes and accessories are now much closer to the in-game look
    * This uses the darkening code from [Xukumi KKShadersPlus](https://github.com/xukmi/KKShadersPlus/blob/main/Shaders/Item/)
    * Dark colors are automatically set in the dark section of the shader
    * Dark versions of all main textures are created and loaded automatically (files that end in _MT_CT.png will be used to generate a file that ends in _MT_DT.png)
    * Dark colors for skin are no longer hard-coded
    * Dark hair and dark skin colors have a different darkening process. These processes aren't used, instead they get the same darkening process as the clothes
* KKBP Exporter updates by **MediaMoots**!
    * Animation curve data is now exported to KK_DynamicBoneData.json
    * SMR dataname fixes

* Transparency should work now when using Lightning Boy Shader
* Initial placement of the Lightning Boy Shader nodes is a little cleaner than before

### Changes for V6.1.0
* Rigify armature updates by an anonymous contributor! (Changelog copy-pasted below)
    * 'Rigified' the new rigged tongue;
    * Moved the eyes and rigged tongue bones to their own layers to reduce clutter in the face layers;
    * Fixed the skirt bones alignment when converted, and also added the sixth bone (cf_j_sk_##_05) to the chains, just in case;
    * Characters without skirt bones are now supported;
    * Connected hair/accessory bones in the same way the CATS plugin does, and changed their widgets from 'circle' to 'limb' type, so the connections with their MCH parents are more apparent;
    * Enabled a small new Rigify adjustment to the toe bones for Blender 3.2+ (this one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H80AjLWgECY );
    * Enabled a small new Rigify feature to the limb bones for Blender 3.3+, which allows you to scale the arms and legs uniformly by scaling the gear control bone at their base;
    * Now the script that is run after the Rigify conversion automatically changes parents and armature modifier targets to the generated rig for all mesh objects in the scene that are related to its metarig; it does it without relying on object names so it should be safe even with multiple characters in the same scene (it detects its metarig from a common bone with a random alphanumeric string in its name). In other words, there's no more need to parent objects with empty groups.
* Multiple bugfixes by **MediaMoots**!
    * See #266, #257, #281
* Basic Cycles shader support!
    * This will make the KKBP materials work in Cycles

    * This will attach the KKBP materials to LBS nodes
    * The LBS addon must be installed for this to work
    * Tested on LBS 2.1.3
* Baking changes
    * Bugfixes to the new baking system
    * The old baking system can now be accessed with the 'old baker' toggle on the KKBP panel 
    * If Blender crashes during the baking process, the baking process will resume where it left off instead of trying to bake everything again.

### Changes for V6.0.0
Huge feature and usability updates by **MediaMoots**!
* The KKBP exporter now works in Koikatsu Sunshine!
* The KKBP Blender plugin now works in Blender 3.1+!
* All outfits are now exported!
    * These are automatically exported from Koikatsu
    * These are available as hidden objects after the model is imported into Blender. They are parented to the armature
    * If you don't want to use these, you can shorten your import time by deleting the "Outfit ##" folder from the export folder 
* Alternate clothing states (shift / hang state) can now be exported!
    * Export these by checking the "Export Variations" box in Koikatsu
    * These are available as hidden objects after the model is imported into Blender. They are parented to the outfit object
* Hitboxes can now be exported!
    * Export these by checking the "Export Hit Meshes" box in Koikatsu
    * These are placed in their own collection when the model is imported into Blender
* The tears object is now exported and available as new shapekeys on the body object!
    * These are parented to the body
    * The tears material also has settings to allow minor color edits
* The eye gag object for heart eyes, firey eyes, etc is now exported and available as new shapekeys on the body object!
    * These are parented to the body
    * The shapekeys will automatically hide the eyes and eyeline materials when active
    * The swirly eye rotation speed, heart eye pulse speed and cry/fire eye animation speed can be changed in the Eye Gag materials 
* The animated tongue is now exported!
    * This is parented to the body object and hidden by default
    * The rigged tongue doesn't use shapekeys like the rest of the face does
* Shapekeys are more accurate than before!
* The heart and sparkle Eye overlays are now exported
* Eyewhite shapekeys are fixed on the exporter-side now!
    * This means Blender is less likely to crash when importing the model
* Small fangs are now exported!
* Accessories are now automatically linked to the correct limb bone!
* Eye and overlay textures are now scaled automatically!
* Hair shine, eyeshadow, nipple and underhair UVmaps are now exported!
    * Thanks to that, these items no longer need to be set and scaled manually for each character
* Converted Normal Maps for use in Unreal and Unity are now exported
* Separated objects can now be exported with the "Export separated meshes" button
* A lot of character info is now exported
    * Check the .json files in the export folder for info on materials, accessories, objects, renderers and bones
* Exported character heights are 4% more accurate
* Texture suffixes are shortened
    * Image names over 64 characters long would cause blender to cufoff the filename, so this means long texture names are less likely to cause issues during import
* The Koikatsu / BepInEx console will now be print out each mesh being exported. If the exporter is not working for a specific character, accessory or clothing item, you can use this to track down what is causing the exporter to fail.
    * These messages are prefixed with [Info   :   Console]

Rigify armature updates by **an anonymous contributor**!
* Better Penetration bones will now be placed in the "Torso (Tweak)" layer when converting to the Rigify armature
    * You need to use the Better Penetration armature type in Koikatsu for these bones to appear

Unity normal blending and mirrored blush scaling by **poisenbery**!
* Unity normal blending is an alternative normal map detail blending method that can be accessed in the "Raw shading" group
* Mirrored blush scaling is an easier way to scale the blush and eyeshadow if the texture is symmetrical. This can be accessed in the "Blush positioning" group on the Face material

Better face normals using shader nodes!
* The face now uses a bastardized version of the Generated Face Normals setup [described in this post by **aVersionOfReality**](https://www.aversionofreality.com/blog/2021/9/5/clean-toon-shading)
* This setup is disabled by default for performance reasons. Enable it by going to the face material > swap the "Raw Shading" node group to "Raw Shading (face)"
* This setup only works in Blender
* The GFN Empty position and scale can be edited by unhiding it. It's parented to the armature
* The GFN options can be edited in the node group called "Generated Face Normals" inside of the the "Raw shading (face)" group

Plus some misc changes to the Blender plugin:
* Added a one-click option for importing models!
    * Hair is now separated from the model automatically, so the entire import process has been reduced to a single button
    * The behaviour from V5.0 (where you can separate objects as you please) can still be accessed by changing the "Don't pause to categorize" option on the upper right to "Pause to categorize", then pressing the "Finish categorization" button when you're done.
* The main plugin UI can now be fully translated!
    * Current languages: English, Japanese (日本語)
* Material baking is now done [through the use of Geometry Nodes!](https://blender.stackexchange.com/questions/231662/)
    * This works with multiple UV maps, so you no longer need to create a new mesh for hair highlights or anything that uses a separate uv map
    * You can also speed up the baking process by skipping the dark and normal bakes if you don't want them
* Exporting can now be done without installing the CATS addon
    * Material Combiner is still required if you want a material atlas
* Added a simplification choices menu to the export prep button
* Removed the vanilla armature type toggle in favor of a menu
    * There's four options to choose from. Check the tooltip for a brief description of each option
    * The ability to switch between armature types after import was removed
* Shapekeys on clothes and hair objects are now deleted
    * Shapekeys only affect the face, so these weren't needed anyway
* The Eye, Eyebrow, Eyewhite, Eyeline and Nose materials are now marked as freestyle faces by default (for freestyle exclusion)
* Lipstick and Flush textures are now loaded into the face material
* Added a safe for work mode toggle that probably works
* The permalight/permadark texture has been merged into one file
* Python errors are now copied to the KK Log in the Scripting tab on the top
* The import directory string listed in the KK Log is now censored if it detects your Windows username
* The plugin now uses an HDRI from polyhaven
* All KKBP panel options are now visible by default
* The KKBP panel will now gray out some buttons after a model is imported  

And many bugfixes

### Changes for V5.1.0
* Added per-character light linking to the KK shader
    * If you have multiple characters in a scene, this allows you to "link" a light to a character, so you can achieve ideal lighting for each character and not have to fiddle with a global lighting setup that affects all characters at once. This works for up to three characters / light sources. It's enabled by default and can be found inside of the Raw Shading group.
    * Usage: Make sure the "Light linking options (open me)" group framed in pink has it's slider set to 1, and any red lights will light your character. Import a second character, return to the ""Light linking options (open me)" group, and open it. Change the output of the pink "Match RGB output and sunlight color for light linking" frame from R to G. Any green lights will light the second character, but not the first character. Using a yellow light will light both R and G characters. Using a white light will light all characters.
* Added reaction to colored light to the KK shader
    * When you use a light that isn't pure white, the colors on the model will become affected by the color of the light. This is disabled by default and can be found inside of the Raw Shading group. Colored lights and light linking can't be used at the same time.
    * Usage: Make sure the "Light linking options (open me)" group framed in pink has it's slider set to 0, and any colored lights will add additional color to your character. Any white lights will light the model like normal.
* Updated Rigify scripts to the latest version (Feb 24th)
* Overlay masks for Body and Face shaders now retain their original color.
    * The "Overlay color" inputs on the body/face shader that used to set the overlay color have been changed to "Overlay color multiplier" inputs. Keep this as a white color to preserve the overlay mask's original color. If the overlay is pure white itself, the color on the multiplier will just set the color of the overlay.
* Added an image slot for the "plain" version of the maintex for clothing items.
    * This can be accessed by going into the clothing shader group and setting the "Use colored maintex?" slider to zero
    * If there's no plain version available, you'll get a pink placeholder texture as a warning
* The permanant light and dark image masks in the raw shading group have been moved to the green texture group
    * This removes the need to create a unique raw shading group for every material.
* Bugfixes ([#94](https://github.com/FlailingFog/KK-Blender-Porter-Pack/issues/94), [#90](https://github.com/FlailingFog/KK-Blender-Porter-Pack/issues/90), [#105](https://github.com/FlailingFog/KK-Blender-Porter-Pack/issues/105), [#114](https://github.com/FlailingFog/KK-Blender-Porter-Pack/issues/114))

### Changes for V5.0.1
* Bugfixes (see [#106](https://github.com/FlailingFog/KK-Blender-Porter-Pack/pull/106), [#95](https://github.com/FlailingFog/KK-Blender-Porter-Pack/issues/95))

### Changes for V5.0.0
* New export plugin, image saturation functions, and automated color setting by **MediaMoots**!
    * These make the import process more than twice as fast as the previous version!

    * Improves the eye controls with extra features like single eye manipulation and eye target tracking
    * Adds FK <-> IK switches to limb bones
    * Makes more armature controls accessible
* Better joint correction bones!
    * Taken from **johnbbob_la_petite** on the Koikatsu Discord
* Better viewport performance using preview quality normal nodes!
    * Taken from **pcanback** [on blenderartists](https://blenderartists.org/t/way-faster-normal-map-node-for-realtime-animation-playback-with-tangent-space-normals/1175379)

    * This allows you to make the Eyes and Eyebrows show through the hair using Cryptomatte and other compositor features
* Shader-to-RGB nodes added to clothing color inputs!
    * This allows you to plug metal and other types of materials into clothing colormask inputs

### Changes for V4.3.1:
* Renamed the spine bones during the "1) Run right after importing" script
    * CATS was not detecting the Spine, Chest and Upper Chest bones correctly. This resulted in the spine and chest bones being merged into one bone with awkward spine bends. Renaming the bones lets CATS detect the three bones correctly.

### Changes for V4.3.0:
* Added a new button to the KK Panel: **Import Studio Object**
    * This script speeds up the import process for an accessory, studio object, or studio map that has been exported as an fbx file with SB3U
    * Example usage video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeryYTsAN6E
    * The shader applied to the object can be left as the default, changed to an emission shader, changed to the KK Shader, or changed to a custom user-defined node group
* Added a new button to the KK Panel: **Link Shapekeys**
    * If the Eyebrows material is separated from the body object, this script will allow you to link the shapekeys values on the Body object to the Eyebrows object
    * Example usage video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqEBau1enWE
        * (click this button instead of running the script in the editor as shown)
    * This can be used for the Eyes and Eyeline materials as well
    * Script source: https://blender.stackexchange.com/questions/86757/
* Added a Center bone back to the armature
    * This bone lets you move all the bones on the armature without moving the armature's object location
* Added a Pelvis bone back to the armature
    * This bone lets you move the pelvis and legs without moving the upper spine
* Edited the armature bone tree a little
* Changed the bone widget shapes in the KK shader to be slightly more rigify-like
* Fixed the orientation of the top skirt bones
* Gave the face material a separate outline
* The "Select unused bones" button now unparents the Hips bone from the new Center bone
    * Leaving the Hips bone parented caused import issues in Unity

### Changes for V4.2.3:
* Made eyewhite operations for the shapekeys optional through a toggle
* Fixed the Basis shapekey being deleted when not set to English

### Changes for V4.2.2:
* The plugin now works in Blender 2.93
* The plugin should now work when Blender's interface is set to any language
* Added lazy crash prevention to the shapekeys button

### Changes for V4.2.1:
* Bake button wasn't assigned correctly in the new panel layout

### Changes for V4.2:
* The eyewhites shapekeys are now used when generating the KK shapekeys
    * This will prevent gaps between the eyewhite and the lower eyelash for certain expressions
* The plugin will now recognize the *KK Better Penetration* body type
    * Toes are placed on armature layer 2
    * BP bones are placed on armature layer 3
* Materials without an image texture should properly bake now
    * This will ensure fully transparent materials and materials that are a solid color (but still use the KK Shader) are baked
* The Separate Body button will now attempt to separate the shadowcast and bonelyfans meshes automatically, then shove them into a collection
* The Import Textures button will now check if the user has actually selected the Textures folder and will abort if they chose the wrong folder
    * This was done to prevent texture loading issues
    * This check can be disabled with a toggle
* Adjusted panel layout
* Added better joint correction for the hip bone
    * In order to use them, the "Enable hip drivers" toggle needs to be enabled before pressing the "5 Add bone drivers" button
* Better descriptions of what each toggle does
* Made using multiple outlines optional through a toggle
* The hair object can now be named either "hair" or "Hair"

### Changes for V4.1.2:
* Added an easier way to scale and move UVs with the "Scale Vector" node group.
    * This replaces the mapping node setup used for the eyes, blush, etc
* Materials that have a maintex or alphamask will now get their own outline material
    * This should prevent transparency issues with the outline
* Added a heel controller to the armature
    * This is for rotating the foot bone while keeping the toes in place; a "tip toe" bone.
* Added HSV sliders for the maintex of general/clothes materials
* Fixed the nsfw texture parser node group in the body shader
* The Bone Widgets collection is now hidden automatically
* Fix bake script to account for world lighting
* Fixed the foot IK
* Moved the "MouthCavity" bone to the secondary layer
* Moved supporting bones to their own armature layers instead of hiding them(layers 17, 18, and 19)
* Relocated bone scaling and armature layer script operations to different buttons
* Moved debug mode toggles to the shapekeys/drivers buttons

### Changes for V4.0.6:
* Fix male body material not being recognized by the scripts
* Added sliders to the body shader to control optional genital textures
    * The genital texture can be loaded into the "NSFW Textures" node group in the body template
    * The file location of the genital texture (cf_body_00_t) depends on what body mod you're using
* Added an example for materials that are partially metal to the KK Shader.blend

### Changes for V4.0.5:
* Quick fix for an issue with the Import Textures button
    * If the body alpha mask did not exist in the "Textures" folder, the script would not handle it correctly

### Changes for V4.0.4:
* Put all the scripts into a blender plugin so the user can press a button instead of having to copy paste scripts
* Added a button that applies the material templates to the model automatically
    * These templates can be edited in the KK Shader.blend
* Added a button that applies the textures to the model automatically
    * *Grey's Mesh Exporter plugin for Koikatsu* is required in order for this to work
    * Colors still need to be set manually
    * This works 90% of the time, so a handful of textures might need to be loaded in manually
* Added custom shapes for the armature to make the important bones more obvious
    * These shapes can be edited in the KK Shader.blend
    * These can be disabled in the armature tab (Armature tab > Viewport Display > Shapes)
* Added second bone layer on the armature for skirt, face and eyebrow bones
    * Multiple bone layers can be made visible at once by shift selecting the layer in the Armature > Skeleton section
